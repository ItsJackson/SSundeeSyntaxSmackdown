# Pulling an object from an array:
The task is simple--Pull an object from an array based upon a specified condition, for this challenge you will need to write code that selects an object from an array based on a given key-value pair.


## Problem Statement :thinking:
- Given an aray of objects, you must pull an object that matches the specified **key-value** pair. If multiple objects match, return the first one. If no object matches, return ``null.``
- See my example input file here.


## Given the following data:
- Your objective is to pull a Fortnite __Legendary__ scar out of a array of weapons from Fortnite. Given the following data pull the scar out of the array, __using the ``id``__ not the __``name``__. 

```js 
const itemsIdx = [
    { id: 1, name: "Rare Assault Rifle" },
    { id: 2, name: "Grey Pistol" },
    { id: 3, name: "Slurp Juice" },
    { id: 4, name: "Chug Jug" },
    { id: 5, name: "Epic Scar" },
    { id: 6, name: "Legendary Scar" }
]
```

## Upload your source code when you're finished to the GitHub Repository, ensure you read the following judging rubric:

Points will be awarded based on:
 - Correctness (Does it work as expected?)
 - Efficiency (Optimized solutions earn more points)
 - Code Readability (Well-structured and commented code is encouraged)
 - Creativity (Bonus points for unique solutions)
 - Judges will review all submissions and announce winners after the event ends.

Good luck coder duders!
